This repository contaisn the code for my solar scanner project. The objective of this project is to use a servo motor to rotate an ultrasonic sensor which outputs different sounds and colored lights depending on the distance of the object from the sensor. This project was made using an Arduino Uno board, jumper wires, a passive buzzer, an RGB LED, jumper wires, 220 ohm resistors, and a servo motor. All software is developed in the Arduino version of C++ within the Arduino IDE.
